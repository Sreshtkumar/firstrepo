            <h3>About me :</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px; color: white;">This is Gask. I'm here with an aim to build a small happy team of software developers with one dev from each domain. I have some knowledge on Back-end and Front-end tech. I would consider myself  more into frontend, but I'm more than happy to help with Back-end stuff as well. </p>
            <h3> My simple goal - </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a Back-end champ.</li>
                <li>Find a Database enthusiast.</li>
                <li>Find an Hibernate brain.</li>
                <li>Find a Dev ops player.</li>
                <li>Find a JIRA killer.</li>
                <li>Find an amazing marketer.</li>
                <li>Looking for a Front-end mate? Here I am!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>And yes :</h3>
            <p>This can be a beginning of our official startup (Yeah we'll name it eventually). It's ours, lets build it together.</p>
            <h3>But why?</h3>
            <p>2023 was all about layoffs, 2024 was all about getting into a new job. Yes, it had been so for many amazing developers. And the struggle we go through to get a job is immeasurable in current scenarios. So let's change this pattern, let's not search for a project, instead let's form a team and let the project find us. This shout is for all such devs who can relate this. Let's be the change.</p>
            <h3>My POV :</h3>
            <p>I don't need any experts, trust me I have a very limited tech knowledge too, just need amazing humble tech lovers who can be graduates or still pursuing their studies or anybody who can think themselves a good fit!</p>
            <h3> Next steps :</h3>
            <p>Once we have the team in place, let's have a productive chat, let's figure out how we can get us a project to work on. </p>
            <p>Let's do this.</p>
            <p>Please nominate yourself and DM me! </p>
            <h3>The END.</h3>
